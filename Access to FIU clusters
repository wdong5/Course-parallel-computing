If you're a Windows user, follow these steps to connect to the remote server using SSH.

## Step 1: Download an SSH Client

You'll need an SSH client to connect to the server. We recommend using one of the following free SSH clients:

1. [MobaXterm (Home Edition)](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html) (Recommended)
2. [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty)

## Step 2: Install and Launch the SSH Client

- Download and install your chosen SSH client from the provided links.
- Launch the SSH client once it's installed.

## Step 3: Connect to the Server

In your SSH client, enter the following connection details:

- **Host Name**: ocelot.aul.fiu.edu
- **Port**: 22 (the default SSH port)

## Step 4: Authenticate

You will be prompted to enter your username and password for authentication.

That's it! You should now be connected to the remote server using SSH.
